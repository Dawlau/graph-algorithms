# Graph theory algorithms

This is a repo that contains the most popular graph algorithms, which have been implemented in [C++](https://www.cplusplus.com/).

## Features

The repo contains the following algorithms:

1) [BFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)
2) [DFS (recursive)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)
3) [Bellman-Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm)
4) [Topological sort (with BFS and DFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting)
5) [Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
6) [Roy-Floyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm)
7) [Max flow (with Edmonds-Karp algorithm)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_flow_problem)
8) [Minimum spanning tree (Kruskal and both variants of Prim's algorithm - for dense and sparse graphs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree)
9) [Kosaraju's algorithm (for Strongly connected components)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosaraju%27s_algorithm)
10) [Biconnected components, bridges and articulation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/biconnected-components/)

## How to run

Run the following commands (Note: for every file, check in the source code what is the name of the input file):

```
$File = "[insert file name here].cpp"
g++ $File -o main
./main
```

## Final notes

I hope you will find these implementation useful. If you find any bugs, feel free to submit them to blahoviciandrei1@gmail.com
